In this section, the performance of the ICS algorithm is extensively investigated by a large number of experimental studies. All computational experiments are conducted with Matlab R2010a, and run on Celeron (R) Dual-core CPU T3100, 1.90GHZ with 2GB memory capacity. The essen- tial parameters of ICS model for the planar graph coloring are set as follows. We simulated 100 runs (nodes 30) and 10 runs (nodesÂ¿30). Let the maximal number of iterations be 10000, the number of nests be 25.
