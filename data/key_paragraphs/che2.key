In the integrated method, the dynamic optimization problems for all potential transitions are first solved offline and they generate a set of controller candidates with the associated transition times and transition costs. The integrated problem is then approximated by a simultaneous scheduling and controller selection problem and it is solved online. In this work, all optimization problems are modeled in GAMS 23.7.3 and solved in a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10 GHz, 8 GB RAM, and Window 7 64-bit operating system. Though the CPU has 4 cores, only 1 core is used in the computation.
