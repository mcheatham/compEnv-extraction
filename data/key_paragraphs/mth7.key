In this section, we will carry out numerical simulation based on some well-known constrained optimization problems to investigate the performances of the proposed ACO-FFA. The selected problems have been well studied before as benchmarks by various approaches. The main characteristics of 10 benchmark problems (i.e., P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9 and P10) are reported in table as shown in Table (1). We will also compare our results with some good results previously reported by the literature to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed ACO-FFA approach. The algorithm is coded in MATLAB 7and is run on a Pentium IV 2.4 GHz processor with 1.0 GB RAM.
