As an illustration of the effectiveness of this method we give a comparison with results for the problem viewed as decision problem achieved by Answer Set Programming (ASP), Propositional Satisfiability (SAT) and Constraint Programming (CP) that are given on the LPNMR’09 web site. The benchmark test set consists of 21 problems of different sizes, and for each it is requested to answer if a solution of a certain number of vertexes exists. For each of the test examples we have conducted two colony runs with a fixed number of iterations (350), and we check if any of the colonies has found a solution with the requested number of vertexes; if it has the problem is satisfied, otherwise it is not. The test have been done on similar hardware (ours slightly better): at LPNMR’09 Dell OptiPlex 745, 1 CPU with 2 cores: GenuineIntel Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz 4 GB RAM, and in our case Dell OptiPlex 755, 1 CPU with 2 cores: GenuineIntel Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU E8500 @ 3.16GHz 3 GB RAM. The software used at LPNMR’09 was created in C++ and our application was made using C# which gives them a speed advantage. Our method had successfully solved all the problem instances and for that it needed 52 seconds. In comparison to this, the best method from LPNMR’09 has solved all the problems in 36 seconds, and the following ones needed 128, 169, 316, 465 and 535 seconds. Although the comparison is not fully accurate it still shows that our method is very competitive.
