We have evaluated our algorithm on several datasets. We have compared our results with direct k-means algorithm in terms of the number of performed distance calculations and the total execution time. A direct comparison with other algorithms (such as the P-Cluster [7] and [13] ) is not feasible due to unavailability of their datasets and software. However, we present some qualitative comparisons. All the experimental results reported are on a IBM RS/6000 running AIX version 4. The clock speed of the processor is 66 MHz and the memory size is 128 MByte.
