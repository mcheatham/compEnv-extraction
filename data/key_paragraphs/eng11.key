To allow an unprejudiced comparison of CPU time, all the experiments were carried out on a PC with a Pentium IV processor running at 2.0 GHz, 512 MB of RAM, and a hard drive of 160 GB. Our execution was compiled using MATLAB R2012b (8.0) running under Windows XP3. No commercial KH or other optimization tools were used in our simulation experiments.
