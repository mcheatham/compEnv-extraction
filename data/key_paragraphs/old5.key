All computations were performed in double precision in serial mode on an SGI Power Challenge L computer with R10000 processors of speed 195 MHz at New York University. Parameter files were used from CHARMM version 19, but the TNPACK code was implemented into CHARMM version 23 with default TNPACK parameters of [23], unless otherwise stated. These parameters are also listed in the TN algorithm of the appendix. No cutoffs were used for the nonbonded interactions of the potential energy function, and a distance-dependent dielectric function was used. The vector norm ∥ · ∥ in all tables and figures is the standard Euclidean norm divided by √n, where n is the number of independent variables of a potential energy function. The inner loop of TN is followed as outlined in Algorithm 1, with τ = 10 and ITPCG = 40 unless otherwise stated.
