The computation time directly depends on the number of surface points used in the calculation. The computation time for tangential field is within 1 minute for most patients using a computer with a 2.13 GHz Intel i3 dual core processor (Lenovo T410i). Even this short time can be further decreased by using an initial estimate of the separating plane for the SVM algorithm and by selecting only surface points within a preset distance from the estimated separating plane. However, introducing the lung/heart blocking increases the computation time by a factor of 8â€“10.
