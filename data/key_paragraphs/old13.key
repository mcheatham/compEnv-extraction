The computational results with random graphs are presented in Table 2. The entries show the average run times in CPU seconds on a 500 MHz PC with Linux operating system. For each entry, ten random graphs were constructed and used as input; the same ten graphs were used for both Old and New. The graphs were constructed by considering each pair of vertices and inserting an edge with probability p. This probability is called the edge density (or edge probability).
