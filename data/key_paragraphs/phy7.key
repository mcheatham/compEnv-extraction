Compared to the existing models (such as HAZUS), the MCS model that was adopted in this study can explicitly provide local damage inflicted on different stories, as evident in Figure 12. It not only provides a more accurate seismic damage result, but also detailed data that enables substantial improvement on the visualization of earthquake scenarios. Furthermore, although the high-fidelity MCS model is used, the required computation time was less than 10 minutes on a desktop computer (i5 processor, 2.8 GHz; 4 GB memory); therefore, the proposed model is notably efficient.
