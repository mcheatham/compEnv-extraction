The release of the publicly sequenced draft human genome necessitated the need for protein family analysis and functional annotation to be performed and made available for researchers. This type of information can be very useful for locating similar genes to a gene of interest or for assigning function to previously unknown genes. To achieve high-quality annotation automatically, functional descriptions for all genome sequences might be obtained from curated database entries, based on detected sequence similarities and subsequent family assignments. To this end, TRIBE-MCL was applied to a full set of peptides from the EnsEMBL 0.80 release (29 691 proteins) of the draft human genome along with a vertebrate subset of proteins from the SwissProt and SPTrEMBL databases (73 347 entries). All protein similarities within these 103 038 proteins were detected using BLAST (12). This information (over 15 million protein similarities) was used by the TRIBE-MCL algorithm to detect all protein families within these three data sets. Given the pre-computed BLAST-based similarities, the clustering step took âˆ¼15 min on a single CPU of a Compaq ES40 server. Finally, the RLCS algorithm (A.J.Enright, unpublished data) was then used to determine a consensus annotation for each detected protein family.
