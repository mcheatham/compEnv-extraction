The GWO algorithm was run 20 times on this problem and the best results obtained are reported in Table 12. Note that the algorithm was run by 24 CPUs on a Windows HPC cluster at Griffith University. This table shows that there is a substantial, 93% and 65% improvement in bandwidth (Dk) and NDBP utilizing the GWO algorithm.
