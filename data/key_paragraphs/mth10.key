In this section, we present the results of our experiments with an implementation of the Algorithm 1 in the computer algebra system CoCoA [11]. This implementation (as well as some test examples) is available online, see [17]. The experiments were run on an Apple Mac Pro with a processor running at 3 Ghz.
