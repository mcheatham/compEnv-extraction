In Fig. 6(b), we show our estimation of the density of states of Ising model on 256 × 256 lattice. Since the density of states for E > 0 has almost no contribution to the canonical average at finite positive temperature, we only estimate the density of states in the region E/N ∈ [−2, 0.2] out of the whole energy [−2, 2]. To speed up our calculation, we divide the desired energy region [-2, 0.2] into 15 energy segments, and estimate the density of states for each segment with independent random walks. The modification factor changes from f0 = e1 ≃ 2.71828... to ffinal = exp(10−7) ≃ 1.0000001.... The resultant density of states can be joined from adjacent energy segments. To reduce the boundary effects of the random walk on each segments, we keep about several hundred overlapping energy levels for random walks on two adjacent energy segments. The histograms of random walks are shown in the inset of this figure. We only require a flat histogram for each energy segment. To reduce the error of the density of states relevant to the accuracy of the thermodynamic quantities near Tc we optimize the parameter and perform additional multiple random walks for the energy range E/N ∈ [−1.8,−1] with same number of processors. For this we use the density of states obtained from the first simulations as starting points and continue the random walk with modification factors changing from exp(10−6) ≃ 1.000001 to exp(10−9) ≃ 1.000000001. The total computational effort is about 9.2 × 106 visits on each energy levels. Note that the total number of possible energy levels is N − 1 and we perform random walks only on [-2, 0.2] out of [-2, 2]. The real simulational effort is about 6.1 × 106 MC sweeps for the Ising model with L = 256. With the program we implemented, it took about 240 CPU hours on a single IBM SP Power3 processor.
One of most important issues for a spin glass model is the low temperature behavior. Because of the slow dynamics and rough phase space landscape of this model, it is also one of most difficult problems in simulational physics. The algorithm proposed here is not only very efficient in estimating the density of states but also very aggressive in finding the ground states. From a random walk in energy space, we can estimate the ground state energy and the density of states very easily. For a spin glass system, after we finish the random walk, we can obtain the absolute density of states by the condition that total number of states is 2N . The entropy at zero temperature can be calculated from either S0 = ln(g(E0)) or lim U−F , where E0 is the energy at ground states. Both T→0 T relations will give the same result since U and F are calculated from the same density of states. Our estimates for s0 = S0/N and e0 = E0/N per lattice site, listed in Table 2, agree with the corresponding estimates made with the multicanonical method. With our algorithm, we can estimate the density of states up to L = 20 by a random walk in energy space for few hours on a 400MHz processor.
