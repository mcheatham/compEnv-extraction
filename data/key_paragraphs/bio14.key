The first analysis consisted of a Classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS;[9]) performed using either the D or the V distance matrix between pairs of individuals using the cmdscale function of R statistical package [50], and adding a constant to avoid negative eigenvalues [51]; Mclust clustering was performed using the first 10 dimensions, and setting the number of clusters from 1 to 60. The second analysis consisted of a spatial ancestry analysis (SPA)[12] conducted to infer the geographic ancestry of each individual in two spatial dimensions. Clusters of individuals were then inferred by means of Mclust using the proposed SPA coordinates, also ranging from 1 to 60. The third analysis was performed with the clusterGem algorithm implemented in the GemTools package which uses spectral graph theory to propose clusters of individuals [52]. Recently, a new software called LOCOLD [53] has been proposed for estimating the geographic locations of a set of individuals. Similar in essence to SPA (i.e. for each SNP it is assumed that there is an allelic gradient), LOCO-LD additionally incorporates LD patterns into the model, which has been suggested to improve ancestry detection. However, the fact that it necessarily requires a training dataset where the localization of some individuals is known a priori (personal communication with the authors) has precluded its use for comparative purposes, as all the other used algorithms are unsupervised. We also aimed to run fineSTRUCTURE, another software that uses LD patterns [26], on the same dataset, after phasing it with the Beagle software [54]. However, computing the shared chunk matrix of all individuals with the default parameters of ChromoPainting [26] turned out to be extremely computationally intensive, even after splitting the genome into chromosomes for parallel computing. As an example, chromosome 22, the smallest human chromosome comprising only 3,698 SNPs in this dataset, has a computational complexity according to the ChromoPainter manual of 96,589,584,000 steps for only one EM iteration. The authors of this software reported in the ChromoPainter manual computation times of 2-3 hours for a computational complexity of 115,543,296 steps using a computer of similar characteristics as the one we used here (8 cpus, 24 GB of RAM). Therefore, it can be expected that the computational time for this chromosome is going to be ,83*(2 to 3) hours. Given that the authors suggest to run ChromoPainter considering different numbers of E-M iterations and parameters, running all 22 chromosomes of this dataset appears beyond reasonable practicability with the computer resources available. Because of this, we decided to exclude this software from comparison.
