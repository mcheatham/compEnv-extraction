Implementation. We implemented our algorithms using C++ and Python. We performed our experiments on a laptop running Intel Core i7-4800MQ @ 2.7GHz CPU with Blender. For each object in our dataset, we tilt it about a fixed tilt axis and run LBM to obtain the containee volumes. Figure 15 shows the results of tilting a pitcher. The curves obtained from Algorithm 1 and LBM show similar trends. To compare, we normalize each curve and calculate the absolute difference between the normalized volumes at each tilt angle. The average difference per tilt angle is 0.083 over all the objects. On average, one simulation by LBM takes 543 seconds (9 minutes) while Algorithm 1 takes 0.06 seconds. Algorithm 1 requires significantly less time and hence is a more favorable choice for our containability analysis which requires numerous evaluations.
