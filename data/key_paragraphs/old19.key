Starting from a linear interpolation between reactant r and product p, an intermediate point a is added after 23 conjugate line-minimizations in the first cycle (D-1 = 23 is the maximum number of line-minimizations per cycle) and further refined to a' with 23 more line-minimizations in cycle 2 (Fig. 3A). Intermediates b and c are added on each side of a' in cycles 3 and 4, which take only 3 line-minimizations, because τ4 > μ in both cycles (Fig. 3B). In cycle 5, a local energy maximum cannot be found on the tangent to the path at a', which at this stage is the peak along the path. Point a' is therefore removed, resulting in a single path segment connecting point c to b (Fig. 3C). Finally, point d is added after 23 line-minimizations in cycle 6, with a RMS-gradient of only 0.4 kcal/molÅ, indicating that d is quite close to the saddle-point (Fig. 3C). More cycles refine point d further (not shown), reducing its RMS-gradient by an order of magnitude at every iteration. After 5 more cycles of 23 line-minimizations, the RMS-gradient is less than 8.10-7 kcal/molÅ. This vanishing gradient and a normal-mode analysis at point d revealing only one imaginary frequency (ν = 164 cm-1) confirms that d is a saddle-point. The activation barrier along the refined path is 3.26 kcal/mol, as compared with 11.9 kcal/mol along the initial line-interpolation between r and p. The whole refinement took less than 2 CPU seconds (all CPU times herein are given for one processor on a Convex 220).
