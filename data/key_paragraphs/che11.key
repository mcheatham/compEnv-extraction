At this time, Jaguar can perform calculations on molecules with up to 1000 atoms and 12,000 basis functions. The largest system that we have tested Jaguar on was a B3LYP/6-31G** energy and forces calculation on a scorpion protein toxin containing 989 atoms and 10,121 basis functions. This calculation was conducted several months ago on a single core of a presently somewhat obsolete AMD Opteron 2427 processor, and required 229 hours to complete. The peak memory usage was 7.0 Gb, which was for the calculation of the atomic forces. The SCF part of the calculation took 173 hours and memory use peaked at 4.7 Gb.
Figures 10–12 show Jaguar’s performance using either MPI or OpenMP in single-point energy calculations, gradient calculations, and vibrational frequency calculations, respectively. These calculations were performed using development versions of Jaguar 8.0 on a cluster in which each compute node contained two sixteen-core AMD Opteron 6274 processors. Each node was equipped with its own local scratch disk and an on-board gigabit ethernet network interface. The MPI calculations were conducted with no more than four processes per compute host, to reduce the cost of I/O contention for the scratch disk.† In these calculations, the unused processors were kept idle.
Sixteen-core AMD Opteron 6274 processors are relatively inexpensive in that they deliver good value per core (performance considerations aside). However, it should be possible to retrieve higher performance from Jaguar on more costly and higher-performance hardware. As an example, in Table 3, we are presenting wall-clock timings and speedups obtained with a development version of Jaguar for geometry optimizations of a molecular cluster consisting of 61 molecules of TiO2 and 58 molecules of H2O. The molecular system is illustrated in Figure 13. The calculations presented in the table were carried out on the Lonestar Linux cluster located at Texas Advanced Computer Center. Each node on the cluster carried two 6-core Intel Xeon 5680 processors. Table 3 presents Jaguar calculations performed on as many as 120 total cores simultaneously. Without this scale of parallelization, projects such as investigation of electronic structure of TiO2 nanoparticles[72] would be impossible to carry out in reasonable time.
