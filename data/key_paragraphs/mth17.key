where u Ìƒ is the unknown clean image. Note that we will not only test the efficiency and the quality of the recovered images of all the three algorithms, but will also test the stability of the algorithms when noise level increases. All the computations are done in MATLAB installed on a desktop with Intel Core i7 (3.4 GHz) CPU and 16.0GB RAM running Window 7.
