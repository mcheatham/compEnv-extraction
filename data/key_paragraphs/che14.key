In silico tests using an in house training set were carried out to assess the software. The results indicated the software can converge in the reasonable time scale about 5â€“10 h on an Intel XEON 2.8G processor for 10 times run of HDAC inhibitor design. From these tests, it was found that the CCLab can find most of the pre-inserted fragments. Furthermore, the software was applied for design of a HDAC inhibitor combinatorial library. Finally, 16 compounds were synthesized and evaluated by bioactivity assays. Among them, 14 compounds showed moderate inhibitory potencies against tested 3 HDAC enzymes, some were exhibited selectivity against HDAC6, and 3 compounds have the IC50 values comparable to the positive control marketed drug SAHA. Clearly, the CCLab software can enhance the hit rates and would be beneficial for combinatorial library design.
