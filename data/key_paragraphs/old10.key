Table 1: Timings for triangulation on a DEC 3000/700 with a 225 MHz Alpha processor, not including I/O. Robust and non-robust versions of the Delaunay algorithms triangulated points chosen from one of three different distributions: uniformly distributed random points in a square, random approximately cocircular points, and a tilted 1000 1000 square grid.
