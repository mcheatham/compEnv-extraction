Table 1 shows the number of dynamics evaluations per second in a single thread. Results are averaged over 100 runs on four different Intel processors: X9650 (3 GHz), X5570 (2.93 GHz), i7 940 (2.93 GHz), X5860 (3.33 GHz). The columns "MuJoCo" and "SD/FAST" involve computing  and b as well as the forward kinematics and the Jacobians of all rigid bodies. The last column adds sparse factorization of  followed by back-substitution; this is only tested in MuJoCo because SD/FAST does not provide sparse factorization.
