The proposed design was computationally experimented with five replications and simulated on personal computers with AMD TurionTM 1.9 GHz CPU and 2.0 GB DDRII RAM. The computational results obtained from 135 (33*5) runs were analysed using a general linear model form of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Table 2 shows ANOVA table consisting of Source of Variation, Degrees of Freedom (DF), Sum of Square (SS), Mean Square (MS), F and P values. A factor with value of Pâ‰¤0.05 was considered statistically significant with 95% confidence interval.
