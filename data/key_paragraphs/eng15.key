In this section, we test on six different functions to verify the algorithm proposed in this paper is feasible and effective such as Table 1. The algorithm is coded in Matlab 7.1, and run on CPU T3100, 1.90GHZ with 2GB memory capacity. The parameters are set as follows: itermax=200, pa=0.25, μ=0.0001, σ0=1.
