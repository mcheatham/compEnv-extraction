Time for the solution of the tridiagonal matrix of rank 966 on a single IBM RS6000/590 processor [15]. The tridiagonal matrix was generated via Householder reduction of the fitting basis set, overlap matrix from a resolution of the identity, second-order Møller– Plesset (RI-MP2) simulation of a flourinated biphenyl
NWChem is available on almost all high performance computing platforms, workstations, personal computers running LINUX, as well as clusters of desktop platforms or work-group servers. NWChem development has been devoted to providing maximum efficiency on massively parallel processors. It achieves this performance on the 512 node IBM SP system in the EMSL’s MSCF and on the 512 node CRAY T3E-900 system in the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. It has not been optimized for high performance on single processor desktop systems.
