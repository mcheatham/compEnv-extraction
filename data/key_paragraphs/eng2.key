Implementation of DE requires the determination of six fundamental issues: DE step size function also called scaling factor (F), crossover probability (CR), the number of population (NP), initialization, termination and evaluation function. The scaling factor is a value in the range (0, 2) that controls the amount of perturbation in the mutation process. Crossover probability (CR) constants are generally chosen from the interval (0.5, 1). If the parameter is co-related, then high value of CR work better, the reverse is true for no correlation [18,19]. DE offers several variants or strategies for optimization denoted by DE/x/y/z, where x = vector used to generate mutant vectors, y = number of difference vectors used in the mutation process and z = crossover scheme used in the crossover operation. In the present study, a population size of NP = 50, generation number G = 100, step size F = 0.8 and crossover probability of CR = 0.8 have been used. The strategy employed is: DE/best/1/exp. Optimization is terminated by the prespecified number of generations for DE. One more important factor that affects the optimal solution more or less is the range for unknowns. For the very first execution of the program, a wider solution space can be given and after getting the solution one can shorten the solution space nearer to the values obtained in the previous iteration. Here the upper and lower bounds of the gains are chosen as (1, Ùè∞è1). The flow chart of the DE algorithm employed in the present study is given in Fig. 2. Simulations were conducted on an Intel, core 2 Duo CPU of 2.4 GHz and 2 GB MB RAM computer in the MATLAB 7.10.0.499 (R2010a) environment. The optimization was repeated 20 times and the best final solution among the 20 runs is chosen as proposed controller parameters. The best final solutions obtained in the 20 runs are shown in Table 1.
