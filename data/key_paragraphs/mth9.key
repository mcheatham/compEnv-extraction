We use Vampire 0.6 [20] as the ATP system for all experiments conducted here. Adding other ATP systems is useful (see, e.g., [33] for recent evaluation), and there are metasystems like MaLARea which attempt to exploit the joint power of different systems in an organized way. However, the focus of this work is on premise selection, which has been shown to have similar effect across the main state-of-the-art ATP systems. Another reason for using the recent Vampire is that in [33], Vampire with the SInE preprocessor was sufficiently tested and tuned on the mml data, providing a good baseline for comparing learning-based premise-selection methods with robust state-of-the-art methods that can run on any isolated large problem without any learning. All measurements are done on an Intel Xeon E5520 2.27GHz server with 8GB RAM and 8MB CPU cache. Each problem is always assigned one CPU.
