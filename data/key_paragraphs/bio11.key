First, in order to compare the convergence speed of two RCGA methods (UNDX + MGG, AREX + JGG), we performed the estimation of parameters in case study 1. In this experiment, we used the recommended default parameter [11,17] of RCGAs as follows: in UNDX + MGG, population size npop was set to 300, the number of offspring nc was set to 100, the number of parents np was set to 2, and in AREX + JGG, npop was set to 200, nc was set to 80, np was set to 21. We regarded the optimization terminated successfully when the total relation error E in Equation (2) is less than 0.1. We performed 50 trials, in each RCGA, and evaluated the performances with the average of 50 trials. Figure 7 shows the average of 50 trials in E of each generation. As shown in Figure 7, it is obvious that the convergence speed of AREX + JGG is faster than UNDX + MGG. In all trials, both methods can be estimated the correct values of parameters shown in Figure 5. Comparing the CPU time (CPU: XeonE5540 2.53 GHz, Memory: 8.0 GB), AREX + JGG was approximately 20-times faster than UNDX + MGG; the CPU time for AREX + JGG was 38.6 sec and that for UNDX + MGG was 765.0 sec. This experiment shows that AREX + JGG is remarkably better than UNDX + MGG in the convergence speed.
