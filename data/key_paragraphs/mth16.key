5.1. Testing Platform. The experimental program testing platform included processor: CPU Intel Core i3-370, frequency: 2.40 GHz, memory: 4 GB, operating system: Windows 7, and run software: MATLAB 7.6.
The running time required for our algorithm to converge is presented in Table 12. It is measured in seconds using processor: CPU Intel Core i3-370 using frequency: 2.40 GHz, memory: 4 GB, operating system: Windows 7, run software: MATLAB 7.6. The comparison of the number of function evaluations required by the DEIWO for all the examples is shown in Table 13.
