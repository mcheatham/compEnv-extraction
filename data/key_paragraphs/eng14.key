4. Numerical examples. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, several examples taken from the optimization literature will be used to show the way in which the proposed approach works. These examples have linear and nonlinear constraints, and have been previously solved using a variety of other techniques, which is useful to determine the quality of the solutions produced by the proposed approach. The presented algorithm is implemented in Matlab (MathWorks) and the program has been run on a T6400 @ 2GHz Intel Core(TM) 2 Duo processor with 2GB of Random Access Memory(RAM). In order to eliminate stochastic discrepancy, in each example, 30 independent runs are made which involves 30 different initial trial solutions with randomly generated a population/colony size(CS) is set to 20 × D, and the maximum iteration or cycle number is 500 in the algorithm for solving the problems. The other parameters for the ABC algorithm is limit = (CS × D)/2 and ABC adopts 5000 × D function evaluations in each run, where D is dimension of the problem. The termination criterion has been set either limited to a maximum number of generations or to the order of relative error equal to 10−6, whichever is achieved first.
