We have systematically conducted a series of simulation experiments, first on a set of artificial Fibonacci sequences (which have been widely used as benchmarks in this field) and then on several actual amino acid sequences. All the simulations were carried out in a Matlab R2013a environment and executed on a 6-core Intel Xeon CPU with 64 GB RAM running at 3.06GHz under Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks.
