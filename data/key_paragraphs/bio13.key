The proposed technique was developed locally and successfully trained in MATLAB version 10.0 using combination of the PCNN, wavelet and neural network toolboxes running under windows-7 operating system with CPU 2.2GHz, Core-Duo processor and 3 GB of memory (RAM). The programs can be run/tested on many different computer platforms where MATLAB is available.
