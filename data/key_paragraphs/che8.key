The helium DBD with trace nitrogen (100 ppm) between two parallel electrodes (5 × 50 mm2) each covered by a ceramic layer (alumina, 1 mm thick) as shown in Fig. 4 is simulated for demonstration of the developed parallel coupling numerical algorithm and the TMSM. The test configuration is similar to that of the experimental study by Chiang et al. [34], except that the length of the electrode becomes 5 mm from the original 50 mm. The helium (30 SLM) flows into the gap (1 mm wide) from the left to the right into an environment filled with air (78% N2 and 22% O2) and impinges on the substrate at the right. The resulting Reynolds number based on the gap distance and the average inlet flow speed is 90, which is a typical laminar flow. The background gas species considered in the GFM solver include helium, nitrogen, and oxygen since they determine the local discharge chemistry and their densities are determined by the flow field and the temperature distribution modeled in the GFM solver. The values of relative permittivity for each region employed in this study are εr ,Discharge = 1.0, εr ,Alumina = 11.63 (measured), εr ,Teflon = 2.1 [35] and εr ,Substrate = 10.0 for some dielectric material. A realistic nearly sinusoidal voltage with Vpeak-to-peak = 6.0 kV and a frequency of 25 kHz is applied to the electrodes. All simulations were performed on the ALPS supercomputing system at the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) of Taiwan with 2.2 GHz of CPU speed and 2.67 GB of RAM per processor.
