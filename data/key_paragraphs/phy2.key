where we believe that all decimal places are correct. This accuracy was obtained by computing the first 10 eigenvalues with a 30 digit precision, the first 500 eigenvalues in quad precision and subsequently by using the simple length spectrum up to l = 9. We relied on the multiplicities of the length spectrum as computed in [AS88]. Note that the spectral determinant and the Casimir energy can both be computed accurately within 5 decimal places without taking the length spectrum into account at all, using the eigenvalues only. Completeness of the list of the first 500 eigenvalues was checked using a list of 700 computed eigenvalues. To compute the first 500 eigenvalues of the Bolza surface to a precision of 12 digits about 10000 Î»-evaluations of generalized singular value decomposition were needed. This took about 10 minutes on a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 quad core processor (where parallelization was used).
