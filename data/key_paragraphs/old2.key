The above-described GA was applied to a 55-taxon problem involving sequences of the chloroplast gene rbcL from a diversity of green plants. The complete alignment used for this study in the form of a data file in nexus format is available over the Internet at the URL http://biology.unm.edu/􏰬lewisp/gaml.html. The GA settings were as follows: number of individuals (n) was 25, automatic number of offspring for best individual each generation (k) was 5, branch length mutation probability (􏰰) was 0.05, topological mutation probability (􏰱) was 0.2, 􏰯 mutation probability (􏰲) was 0.1, recombination probability (r) was 0.2, and the gamma shape parameter (􏰮) used to modify branch lengths and the 􏰯 parameter was 500. Three separate GA runs were performed using three distinct random number seeds. All three runs were terminated when no improvement in the lnL of the best tree was observed in 2,000 generations. All three runs were performed on a Silicon Graphics Origin200 (180 MHz R10000 processor) running IRIX 6.4. The first run required 7,970 generations and 16.3 h of CPU time to obtain the final tree, which had a lnL score of 􏰪24,649.87077. When the branch lengths of this tree were optimized using PAUP* 4.0 (d57), the lnL improved only slightly, to 􏰪24,649.76591 indicating that the GA performs reasonably well at fine-tuning branch lengths. The second GA run required 5,568 generations and 11.3 h of CPU time to arrive at a tree having lnL 􏰫 􏰪24,598.09758 (which optimized to 􏰪24,597.90788 using PAUP*). Finally, the third run required 7,278 generations and 14.8 CPU h and found a tree better than either of the first two runs with lnL 􏰫 􏰪24,583.428507 (figs. 3 and 4). Optimization of branch lengths with PAUP* resulted in only a slightly increased lnL (􏰪24,583.09827). In total, the three GA runs required 42.4 h of CPU time.
