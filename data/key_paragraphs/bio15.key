The algorithm is implemented in C/C++ and run on a 16 core red hat linux box with 3.2GhZ HT Xeon CPU and 8GB RAM. Population size P is set to 500, and SIfTER is run for N = 100 generations. The analysis summarized in the Supporting Information (bottom panel of S6 Fig) indicates that this number of generations is sufficient to allow SIfTER to converge; indeed, convergence is observed around generation 50. The reproductive operator uses a maximum step size of 1. The local selection operator uses neighborhood C25, and cell widths of 1. Total run time for application of SIfTER on a given Ras sequence is approximately 72 hours on 16 CPUs (16 processes are used to alleviate the computation burden of the Rosetta relax protocol employed when improving offspring). Finally, it is worth noting that the results shown in this paper are not exploiting particular runs of SIfTER. Instead, the algorithm is run many times, and comparison of energy landscapes and convergence across the different runs (data shown in Supporting Information in S7 Fig) allow us to conclude that the results presented here are representative of the capabilities of the algorithm and reproducible.
