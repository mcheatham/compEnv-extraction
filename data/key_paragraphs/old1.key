The GA described in Materials and Methods required as input the approximate size and location of the active site, together with coordinates of the protein and a ligand conformation. As GOLD used a cavity detection procedure to further de速ne the active site, the size and location input by the user was not critical. Although the determination of the active site is not currently automated, there are techniques available that are capable of predicting the location of the active site with considerable accuracy (Peters et al., 1996). The output was the ligand and protein conformations associated with the 速ttest chromosome in the population when the GA run terminated. Since GAs are non-deterministic algorithms, 20 GA runs were performed in each docking experiment in order to ensure that most high-af速nity binding modes would be explored. In most cases similar results were obtained and, in general, the algorithm does not need to be run 20 times to elucidate a binding mode. In the examples that follow, the best solution refers to the predicted binding mode (i.e. the result from the 20 runs that had the highest GA 速tness score) and not to the solution that was closest to that observed in the crystal structure. Depending on the complexity of the docking problem, each GA run would take anything between three and 35 minutes on a Silicon Graphics R4400 Indigo II workstation. Due to the rapid and sustained increase in CPU performance, computing time can be expected to reduce substantially in the future.
