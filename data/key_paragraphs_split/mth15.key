To illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, a series of test problems are selected from the literature [11, 12, 15, 19–26]. These problems are composed of different classes of bilevel programming problems, namely, the leader’s problems involving linear, quadratic, fractional, nondifferentiable, and nonconvex objective functions. The variety of dimension and functional forms makes it possible to fairly assess the robustness of the proposed approach within tolerably computational time. In the simulation, the proposed EDA
