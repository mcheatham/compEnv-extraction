We timed hull, hullio (a precursor of hull without exact arithmetic, personal communication, S. Dorward, 1992), triangle [Shewchuk 1996] (a two
-
dimensional Delaunay triangulation program with exact arithmetic), and our implementation of Quickhull (qhull 2.2) on a Silicon Graphics 100MHz R4000. These are fastest implementations known to the authors. We used a Sun SPARCstation for performance tuning of qhull. The times are the average and range of user CPU seconds for 10 different trials.
