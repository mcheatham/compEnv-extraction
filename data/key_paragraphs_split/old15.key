D using the VS Fortran compiler. As now coded, the subproblems encountered at Step 1 are solved with the linear programming (LP) subroutine library XMP (Marsten (1981)); however, any LP package including those based on interior point methods could be used. Multiplier values required to be zero on a given iteration are accommodated by fixing their upper and lower bounds at zero. Similarly, constraints required to be binding are satisfied by setting their slacks to zero. Both of these operations are easily handled in XMP by a subroutine call. All variable bounds are treated implicitly, so additional constraints are not needed in the formulation.Bialas and Karwan (1984) report results for both their "Kth

best" algorithm and their Parametric Complementary Pivot (PCP) approach. (While the former did not fare too well and will not be discussed, the latter should really be considered a heuristic because convergence is not guaranteed. In addition, it is limited by the requirement that the leader’s objective function coefficients associated with the follower’s variables be nonnegative; i.e., c2_>

 0.) The largest problems they solved contained 50 variables, with 20 being controlled by the follower. The number of constraints was fixed at 0.4 times the number of variables. Each data set contained five problems, and all computations were done on a CDC Cyber 174 using a Fortran IV code.
