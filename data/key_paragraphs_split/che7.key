The benchmark tests were performed on the cluster at the National Institute of Chemistry (NIC) in Ljubljana, Slovenia. This cluster is composed of 18 state

Further tests were run on a heterogeneous system obtained by connecting to an additional cluster at the JozË‡ef Stefan Institute (IJS) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, comprising 37 computing nodes, each with a single quad

core Intel Xeon 5520 2.26 GHz processor. These nodes ran under the Ubuntu 11.04 operating system. The topology of the NIC and IJS clusters is shown in Figure 2. One of the nodes in each cluster acts as a gateway to the Internet. The nodes of both clusters are interconnected with Gigabit Ethernet links; however, both gateway nodes can communicate with a maximum bandwidth of 100 Mb/s. The MPI library requires that all computing nodes belong to the same network address space; therefore, a virtual private network (VPN) was established for the tests involving both IJS and NIC clusters. The VPN server resided on the gateway computer of the IJS cluster. Computers of the IJS cluster were connected to it directly, whereas computers of the NIC cluster communicate via the NIC gateway node. The Mpich2 1.2.1 library was used as an implementation of the MPI standard[21] on both clusters.
