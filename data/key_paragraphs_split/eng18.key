We performed experiments on a machine with a 3.16GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU with 6144KiB L2 cache running Linux (Ubuntu 12.04, 64bit, kernel 3.2). All programs were compiled using g++ version 4.6.4 with

DNDEBUG options. To reduce the time to run the experiments, we artificially restricted the RAM size to 2GiB using the Linux boot option mem, and the algorithms were allowed to use at most 1.5GiB. We used two big test files: a concatenation of three diâ†µerent Human genomes1,2,3 (hg) and a prefix of the English Wikipedia dump4 (enwik).
