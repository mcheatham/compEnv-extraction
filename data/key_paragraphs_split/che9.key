In this large scale case study, 3 freshwater sources are considered, and the freshwater withdrawal availability of each is estimated based on historical flow rates in the Marcellus shale play with consideration of seasonal fluctuations.13,61 Three shale sites are included, and each can drill up to 4 to 8 wells at maximum.62 The whole process from well drilling to well 14 completion takes roughly three months,time period in this model. Drilling activities are confined to the first 3 years. An exponentially decreasing approximation of the shale gas production profile is considered, given as a function of time depicted in Figure S6 in Supporting Information.14 Drilling water demand is assumed to be dependent on the number of wells drilled. Produced water is assumed proportional to the amount of shale gas produced.40,63 There are 5 Class II disposal wells,64 3 commercial CWT facilities,65 and 3 types of onsite desalination technologies, namely MSF, MED, and RO.66,67 There are 2 potential conventional shale gas processing plants,46 2 depleted natural gas fields as underground storage sites,48 and 2 Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) power plants with 50% generation efficiency based on LHV.27,68 The total planning horizon is 10 years, which is close to the real productive life of Marcellus wells, divided into 40 time periods, i.e. one

quarter per time period.14,69 All detailed input data are based on existing literature and provided in the Supporting Information. It is worth noting that due to the development of performance standards and regulation standards, some of the assumptions applied in the data sources, regarding drilling, production, storage, transportation, infrastructures et al., might not be suitable for the latest practices. Besides, the corresponding GHG emissions could be reduced because of these recent practices. Nevertheless, the proposed modeling framework and solution methods are general enough that can be easily adapted to these updates. The resulting problem has 5028 continuous variables, 203 discrete variables, and 6907 constraints. All of the models and solution procedures are coded in GAMS 24.4.170 on a PC with Intel Core i5

bit operating system. Furthermore, the MILP problems are solved using CPLEX 12.6. The MINLP solvers utilized include global optimizers SCIP 371 and BARON 14.72 The absolute optimality tolerance for all solvers is set to 0. The optimality tolerance tol for the inner loop in the proposed global optimization method is set to 10−2, and δ for the outer loop is set to 10−2. Detailed computational performance data are provided in the Supporting Information.
