We executed our experiments on one core of an Intel (R) Core (TM) i7 CPU PC at 2668 MHz that is equipped with 8 192 MB cache and 8 GB RAM running Ubuntu Linux 11.10. We used the GNU c
-
compiler g++ (version 4.3.3), and all program compilations were optimized with 
-
O3. For easy referencing we call our approximate TSPTW solver mTSP.
