Our implementation of the SOE algorithm is of order n√óm, where n is the number of iterations and m is number of gammas used in the reconstruction. Thus, the runtime is linearly dependent on the number of gammas used in the reconstruction but independent of the VPP used by the SOE algorithm. For the reconstructions presented in this work, 10,000 iterations with 1M gammas were completed in <3 hours on a single AMD Opteron 6128 HE, 2000 MHz CPU running Linux kernel 2.6.18. Improvements in the reconstruction speed could be easily achieved by parallelization of the code and/or implementation on a graphics processing unit (GPU) as shown by Andreyev et al (2011). However, the purpose of this study was not optimization of the reconstruction code, and therefore reconstruction times on the order of ~3 hours were deemed sufficient.
