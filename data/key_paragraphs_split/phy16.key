cores technologies brings opportunities for HEP experiments to take advantage of SIMD and SIMT computing models. Launched in 2013, the GeantV project studies performance gains in propagating multiple particles in parallel, improving instruction throughput and data locality in HEP event simulation on modern parallel hardware architecture. Due to the complexity of geometry description and physics algorithms of a typical HEP application, performance analysis is indispensable in identifying factors limiting parallel execution. In this report, we will present design considerations and preliminary computing performance of GeantV physics models on coprocessors (Intel Xeon Phi and NVidia GPUs) as well as on mainstream CPUs.Figure 2. Performance results of simulating particles that undergo EM processes using the alias sampling method tested on Intel⃝R Xeon Phi 5110P (Knight Corner): (left) the ratio between the CPU time taken by the alias method and by the Geant4 composition and rejection method (both scalar codes), (right) the relative speedup of the vector backend using Vc and the IMCI (MIC) instruction set with respect to the scalar.Figure 3.
