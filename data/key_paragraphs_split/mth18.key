In this section, the benchmark suite consists in three nonlinear multimodal functions that differ in terms of various characteristics. They are used to evaluate application performance of ICOMM. To examine the effectiveness of this method involving the multifold map, we apply ICOMM for each function. We use different values of steps size λ,λgl1 and λgl2. For each trial we use 48 random initial points (48 runs); on a 3.2 GHz Pentium IV processor with 2 GB of RAM. For all the studied cases, the four configurations, numbered from C1 to C4, that are used are presented in Tab. 1
