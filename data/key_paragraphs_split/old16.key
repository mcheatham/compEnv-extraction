These results are remarkable because in all cases speedups greater than the number of physical processors were obtained. The gain is due to the numerical properties of the deflation portion of the parallel algorithm. We do not full understand why the algorithm performs as much deflation as is apparent by the comparisons. In all cases the word length was 64 bits and the same level of accuracy was achieved by both methods. The measurement of accuracy used was the maximum 2

norm of the residuals Tq − λq and of the columns of Q T Q − I . The results in Table 8.1 are typical of the performance of this algorithm on random problems with speedups becoming more dramatic as the matrix order increases. In problems of order 500 speedups of 15 have been observed on the CRAY

4 and speedups over 50 have been observed on the Alliant FX/8, which are 4 and 8 processor machines respectively. The CRAY results can actually be improved because parallelism at the root finding level was not exploited in the implementation run on the CRAY but was fully exploited on the Alliant.
