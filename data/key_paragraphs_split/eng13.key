To allow a fair comparison of running times, all the experiments were performed on a PC with a Pentium IV processor running at 3.0 GHz, 1 GB of RAM and a hard drive of 160 Gbytes. Our implementation was compiled using MATLAB R2012a 􏱝7.14􏱞 running under Windows XP. In the following, we will describe the problem we use to test the performance of the TS/BBO.
