We compared the performance of Monte Carlo simulated annealing ŽSA., the genetic algorithm ŽGA., and the Lamarckian genetic algorithm ŽLGA.. The new empirical free energy function presented here was used for energy evaluation in all cases. Dockings were performed using approximately the same number of energy evaluations Ž􏱍1.5 million., so each method could be judged given similar computational investments. The CPU time taken for a single docking varied from 4.5 to 41.3 minutes, on a 200
