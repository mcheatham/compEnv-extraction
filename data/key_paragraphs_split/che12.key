A published EDC cross

linking dataset (McIlwain et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2008) of human cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450) and cytochrome b5 (B5) was used to test the program. The dataset contains 3314 spectra, and was collected using an LTQ

Orbitrap with high resolution for both the precursor and MS2 masses. The search was performed with three missed cleavages and a 50 ppm precursor and 20 ppm fragment m/z tolerance against both the target and decoy version of the database. The decoy database was built with reverse sequences of the two proteins plus twice the number of randomized sequences, with 5.4 times larger search space compared with the target database. Figure 1a shows a plot of score versus precursor m/z error. The majority of high score hits observed have a precursor mass error within 􏰏5 to 20 ppm, and decoy hits have a maximum score of 3.22. As a result, using 􏰏5 to 20 ppm and a score of 3.22 as a threshold should give a false discovery rate (FDR) close to 0. With these parameters, we discovered 163 high confidence peptide

linking search engine, xQuest (Rinner et al., 2008), as well as comparison with previously published results from Crux (Table 2, McIlwain et al., 2010) and Popitam (Table 1, Singh et al., 2008). XQuest was searched using the same parameters as SQID

XLink and the FDR was determined with the same target

decoy database search strategy. We use published Popitam and Crux results directly instead of using our own search results because Popitam needs an additional algorithm to pre

filter the data and need extensive manual interpretation to associate the modification mass with peptide sequence, while Crux relies on its own FDR estimation system which needs the optimization of many parameters. The published data were already optimized by the authors and manually verified, so they represent the best performance of the two algorithms. Our results show that SQID
