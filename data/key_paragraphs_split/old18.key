For testing purposes, we randomly assigned charged particles to positions in the computational cell (Fig. 7), with charge strengths between 0 and 1, and with the numbers of particles varying from 100 to 12,800.The calculations were performed on a VAX

digit accuracy of the result. In each case, we performed the calculation in three ways: (1) via the algorithm of the present paper in single precision arithmetic; (2) directly (via formula (2.7)) in single precision arithmetic; and (3) via formula (2.7) in double precision arithmetic. The First two calculations were used to compare the speed and accuracy of our algorithm to those of the direct method. The direct evaluation of the field in double precision was used as a standard for comparing the relative accuracies of the first two computations. In all cases,the calculation was performed for a periodic model, the periodic boundary condition being imposed by means of the algorithm described in Section 4 of this paper.
