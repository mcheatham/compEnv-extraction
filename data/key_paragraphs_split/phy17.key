Abstract—The results of tests for the track􏰓reconstruction efficiency and the speed of the algorithm and its scalability with respect to the number of cores of the server with two Intel Xeon E5640 CPUs (in total 8 phys􏰓 ical or 16 logical cores) are presented and discussed.In the present paper, we report the results of testing the track􏰓reconstruction algorithm in the STS detec􏰓 tor of the CBM experiment on the Laboratory of Information Technologies, Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR LIT), multicore server with two Intel Xeon E5640 CPUs (in total 8 physical or 16 logical cores). A cellular automaton (CA) and a Kalman filter are at the heart of this algorithm, which allows for par􏰓 allel event processing both in the optimal use of all the server cores and in data exchange.An eight􏰓core server cuda.jinr.ru (LIT JINR) is used for testing the time characteristics of the algo􏰓 rithm (Fig. 9). The server has two Intel Xeon E5640 CPUs, each including four cores with a frequency of 2.66 GHz and 12􏰓Mbyte third􏰓level cache memory. The random access memory of 45 Gbyte is distributed equally between the two processors. Hyper􏰓threading permits using each physical core in the form of two logical cores.
