In this paper, we introduced a novel MD/kMC technique, which is based on a dynamical redefinition of biases and a renormalization of its magnitude in relation to the unbiased gradient. The renormalization guarantees sampling of the underlying partition function. To account for the energy fluctuations in peptide aggregation simulations, we introduced a factor ε which applies fluctuations on the bias, while the ensemble average is maintained. We tested our novel algorithm on Dialanine and folding of 2 peptides : TrpCage and TrpZip4. Finally, we applied our algorithm in aggregation simulations of one monomeric fragment of Aβ 1622 to a double stranded fibril of the same peptide. We observe quantitative agreement of folding times of Dialanine and both peptides with unbiased MD simulations and prior kMC/MD results. In the aggregation simulations, we find a heterogeneous free energy landscape of the free monomer. The initial aggregation events are in agreement with the dock

termini of the monomer and the fibril, which is followed by the formation of hydrophobic contacts (Phe19, Phe20). In that strongly aggregated state, the monomer diffuses along the surface of the fibril with a preference of the monomer to reside near the termini of the fibril in a parallel orientation to the fibril strand axis. The bias introduced into the kMC/MD method is adaptive and does not directly introduce a priori a reaction coordinate for the attachment of the monomer to the terminus of the fibril, which is a significant advantage in contrast to widely used umbrella sampling and Metadynamics methods, while the computational cost is much lower compared to conventional REMD.
