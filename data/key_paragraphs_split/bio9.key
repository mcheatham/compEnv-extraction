To begin with, we provide three examples to show the typical characteristics of parameter estimation problems. The first example is the modeling of biosystems by stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as presented in [102]. The metabolic pathway model is shown in Fig. 5. In the model, there are 16 real parameters, while the search ranges of these parameters are in 1⁄20:1; 1;000􏰑. According to [102], the ODE model is stiff, which means that it will take a long time to reach a solution of the ODEs. Adopting the fourth order Runge

Kutta method as the ODE solver with a time step 0.0001, the fast algorithm developed in [102] still took about 10 hours to obtain an optimal solution with 10 percent relative error w.r.t the experimental data on a computer with Pentium 4, Xeon 2 GHz CPU with a memory size of 1,024 MB.Another example is the stochastically simulated gene network as discussed in [153]. In the three

gene repressilator model as shown in Fig. 6, the concentration trajectories are simulated by a hybrid jump/continuous Markov process due to Salis and coworkers [137], [138], which is a stochastic simulation process. The stochastic nature of the simulation indicates the noisiness in evaluating the trajectories. To reduce the nosiness, the authors in [153] calculated the ensemble average of 􏰆 simulations. In the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm developed for the three

gene model, to estimate the six positive real parameters, the authors required 24 􏰍 􏰆 Intel Itanium 2 CPU at 1.5 GHz hours.
