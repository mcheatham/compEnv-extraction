In this section, we present computational experiments on benchmark instances of the PVRP and the PTSP from the literature, as well as on realistic instances presented in [24]. All the tests were performed on an Intel Xeon 2.67 GHz CPU. SC

heur was executed with a time limit of 2 h.Table 5 shows the computing times in minutes. We report the computing times as in [24]: CGL was run on a Dell Precision T7400 with four processors at 3.0 GHz CPU (a single processor was used to run the tests), ALP was run on a Corel 8400 PC at 2.66 GHz, HDH algorithm was run on a 64 bits dual core PC, at 3.2 GHz, and GRASP was run on a Corel 8400 PC with a 2.66 GHz CPU.
