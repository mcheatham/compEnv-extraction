Here we introduce a fast and highly versatile off
-
target searching tool, Cas
-
OFFinder. Importantly, Cas
-
OFFinder is written in OpenCL, an open standard language for parallel programming in heterogeneous environments, enabling operation in diverse platforms such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs) and digital signal processors (DSPs).To evaluate the performance of Cas
-
OFFinder, we first chose arbitrary SpCas9 target sites in the human genome and ran CasOFFinder with query sequences via CPU (Intel i7 3770K) or GPU (AMD Radeon HD 7870). Notably, running time per target site was decreased as the number of target sites was increased (Fig. 1C). This result is expected because the searching kernel works only once for many input targets. The speed of CasOFFinder based on GPU (3.0s) was 20Ùè∞Ü faster than that of CPU (60.0s) when 1000 target sites were analyzed. We also used Cas
-
OFFinder to search for potential off
-
target sites of NmCas9, which recognizes 50

NNNNGMTT
-
30 (where M is A or C) PAM sequences in addition to a 24
-
bp target DNA sequence specific to guide RNA in human and other genomes (Table 1). Note that Cas
-
OFFinder allows mixed bases to account for the degeneracy in PAM sequences.
