Our algorithms are implemented in C for performance purposes and are freely available.1 Particular attention has been given to the performances of our algorithms since the low time complexity of our methods (in real use cases rather than on generic graphs) is one of the main results presented in this paper. Computation times given in Section IV

B have been obtained on commodity hardware with a CPU clock rate of 2.53 GHz.
