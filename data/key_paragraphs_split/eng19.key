The experiments are taken on the personal computer with an Intel Core
-
i7 950 3.0 GHz CPU, 12GB RAM, Windows 7 64bits OS, with Matlab Version 7.6.0.324 (R2008a). The total population size is set to 20 and the dimension of the solution space is set to 30 (M = 30). Each test function contains the full iterations is repeated by 25 runs with different random seeds. The final result is obtained by taking the average of the outcomes from all runs. The initial range and the total iteration number for all test functions are listed in Table 1. The parameter setting for BA and our proposed method are listed in Table 2. The outcome and the computational time are listed in Table 3.
