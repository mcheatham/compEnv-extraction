For the performance comparison discussed here, a single 2048 􏰁 2048 pixel slice has been reconstructed from a 1501 􏰁 2048 pixel sinogram on a machine equipped with 12 Intel Xeon processors clocked at 2.67 GHz (using though only one single core) and 36 GB RAM. Table 1 lists the time required for slice reconstructions using different algorithms and amounts of zero

padding (ZP = 0.5 means an extension of each sinogram side by half of the original field of view).
