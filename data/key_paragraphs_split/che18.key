All calculations were performed using MATLAB version 2007b (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA); the LibSVM toolbox was used for SVM classifications. The parallel GA scripts developed in

house are based on the Distributed Computing Toolbox (MathWorks) for the parallelisation, the Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithm Toolbox (developed by Hartmut Pohlheim, GEATbx, Berlin) for the basic evolutionary operators, the PLS Toolbox (Eigenvector Research, Manson, WA) for pre

processing and the LibSVM toolbox (Software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm) for the SVM classification. The programme runs on a High Performance Computing Cluster (Transtec AG, TuÌˆbingen) with one master computer and 4 computing nodes using 2 dual core AMD Opteron processors. With the parallel GA running on this 16 processor architecture, a speed increase by a factor of around 12 is generally observed as compared to that achieved using a single processor.
