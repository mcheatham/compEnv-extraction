The HGSO are coded in MATLAB R2009a and impletmented on 2.00GHz CPU machine with 1.92GB RAM under Windows XP platform. The parameters of the HGSO are set as follows: population size N = 250, the luciferin decay constant ρ = 0.4, the luciferin enhancement constant γ = 0.6, the rate of change of the neighbourhood range β = 0.08, the neighbourhood threshold nt = 5, step
-
size of the movement s = 0.03, the initial luciferin value l0 = 5, the maximum number of attempts of glowworms in predatory behavior trynumber = 15, scaling factor F = 0.4, mutation probability CR = 0.9, annealing rate λ = 09415, step size of the local search η = 0.00315, the number of iterations of the local search at each generation L = 20.
