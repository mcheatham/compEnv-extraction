In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the number of fielded HSI systems that utilize QUAC. This has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate QUAC performance over a wide range of measurement conditions (different sensors, different types of scenes, etc.). QUAC usually provides good results; however, it can fail badly on occasion. A primary focus of our latest work is to understand the reasons for these failures and upgrade QUAC to yield good results for these and similar cases. We have also improved the computational speed by a factor of approximately 2. The CPU time required to correct a typical AVIRIS data cube (500 × 500 pixels, 220 bands) is now ∼3 s for a PC (64
