adapted DMRG algorithms on 2 Intel Xeon E5420 processors with 4 cores each. Spinse is the singlet embedding technique where we add a set of non

interacting orbitals and then target the S = 0 state of the combined system (see text for more details). Ratio denotes the ratio of the best spin

adapted timings. Note that the singlet embedding technique greatly reduces the cost of the spin

adapted DMRG calculation for the triplet state.
