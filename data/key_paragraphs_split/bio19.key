ES calculations were performed on a CPU in Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) with function calls to an externally compiled C++ library for computing DRRs and similarity metric on a GPU using CUDA (nVidia, Santa Clara, CA).where is the projection of the ith target point computed by a projection matrix (equation (1)) estimated by the registration and is the projection computed by the true projection matrix. Target points were manually defined in the CT volume at the approximate centroid of each vertebra. The 9

DOF registration was compared against a conventional 6

DOF registration, the latter assuming a fixed source position (x, y, z)s = (0, 0, 1000) mm. All calculations were performed on a desktop Windows 7 64 bit workstation with an Intel Xeon 2 processor (2.4 GHz) and GeForce TITAN GPU (nVidia, Santa Clara, CA).
