A multicore cluster was used to carry out these experiments. It consists of 16 nodes powered by two octa
-
core Intel Xeon E5
-
2660 CPUs with 64 GB of RAM. The cluster nodes are connected through an InfiniBand FDR network. OpenMPI library version 1.6.2 has been used to compile the parallel implementations, and the experiments were carried out using from 1 to 30 processors. In these benchmarks, the execution of only one test of seqDE could take hours or even days to complete. For each experiment 30 independent runs have been performed.
