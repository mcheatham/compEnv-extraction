We illustrate the capabilities of our approach using two case studies, which have been solved following the steps summarized in Fig. 7. The first addresses the design of hydrogen supply chains (a problem in the area of green engineering), while the second deals with the multi

objective optimization of metabolic networks (taken from the field of systems biology). In both cases, our method was compared against the full space MILP model introduced by Guillén
