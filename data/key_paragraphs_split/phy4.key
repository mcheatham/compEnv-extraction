Finally, we measure the run
-
time of each algorithm for all bulk phases discussed previously. The benchmark was performed on a computer equipped with an Intel Core2 Quad Q9550 processor running at 2.83 GHz and 4 GB of DDR2 RAM running at 1066 MHz. All source code was compiled using the GNU gcc compiler version 4.5.1. The operating system was a 64
-
bit OpenSuSE Linux with Kernel 2.6.37. Each algorithm was running single
-
threaded and computed the neighbor sets for all particles in the system. To improve accuracy whenever the run
-
time was near our time resolution we measured the total time of 10 sequential repetitions. All data presented are averages over at least 3 separate program runs.
