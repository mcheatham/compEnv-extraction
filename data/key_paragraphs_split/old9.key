We implemented the QRS detection algorithm in assembly language. It operates on either a Z80 (Zilog) or an NSC800 (National Semiconductor) microprocessor. All the processing is done with integer arithmetic so that the algorithm can operate in real time without requiring excessive computing power. The database provides two simultaneous ECG channels. We attempted two
-
channel analysis, but abandoned this approach. Due to the way that the electro depositions are orthogonally placed in Holter recording, a high
-
quality signal on one channel normally implies a low
-
amplitude ECG with a poor signal
-
to
-
noise ratio on the second channel. The only way that two
-
channel algorithms wil yield improved performance for most patients is by adopting a new way of electro deplacement that will provide usable signals in both channels.
