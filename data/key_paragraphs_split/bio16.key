PSO. The solutions obtained using the PSO variants are utilized to construct the approximate Pareto frontier. The algorithms employed in this work were programmed using the C++ programming language on a personal computer with an Intel⃝R CoreTM i5 processor running at 3.2 GHz. The entire Pareto frontier was constructed using 53 solutions at various weights attained for each of the PSO variants. The degree of dominance these solutions is measured using the HVI. The nadir point or the measurement reference in the HVI is (q1, q2, q3, q4) = (0, 0, 0, 0). Each solution point obtained is selected by taking the best solution obtained from 10 independent runs of the algorithms (for each of the individual weights). The individual solutions for specific weights of the PSO variants were assessed based on the value of the aggregate objective function (weighted
