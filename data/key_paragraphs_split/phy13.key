This is a small prostate case with 50 221 voxels and 943 beamlets. We implemented the algorithm in Matlab, and ran the code on a PC with Intel Core i7 3.40 GHz CPU and 12 GB RAM. Two distinct scenarios are investigated for this case: (1) the reference DVHs are inside the feasible region (feasible DVHs), (2) the reference DVHs are outside the feasible region (infeasible DVHs). We will show that the algorithm generates a plan with DVHs better than the reference ones for the first scenario, while it finds a plan with DVHs worse than, but similar to, the reference ones for the second scenario.
