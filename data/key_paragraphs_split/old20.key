Computational speed is of importance, since 600 independent wavepacket propagations have to be performed for a given initial vibrational state. Each single calculation is specified by a set of initial quantum numbers (ν, j, J, K). Total angular momentum values up to Jmax = 40 were necessary to obtain converged results in the energy range under investigation. The computational cost for a single calculation on a 400 MHz Dec

alpha workstation varies between 60 and 90 minutes CPU time, depending on the initial quantum numbers. This is fast but the CPU times are comparable with those of other optimised wavepacket propagation methods. If one takes into account that H+D2 is a small but strongly coupled system, this fact is very encouraging. When turning to larger systems we therefore expect MCTDH to perform considerably faster than standard wavepacket propagation. Note that the MCTDH memory requirements are always low. The present calculations need only 5 MB RAM.Comparison of computational resources needed for the propagation of pyrazine including 4 modes. The first column enumerates the calculations made. The second column selects between the integration schemes. The label “exact” refers to the standard method, Sec. 2.2. In the third column the type of single

particle function basis with respect to the electronic degree of freedom is specified (see Sec. 3.5). Column four defines whether standard, interaction picture, or natural orbitals were used. The next two columns give the CPU time and memory required on an IBM RS/6000 power2 workstation. Finally, “Error” is the maximum error of the calculation with respect to the standard method calculation, i.e. ∥ Ψ − Ψexact ∥. Note that an error of 0.01 is equivalent to an overlap of 0.99995 (see Eq. (160)).
