So far, we fixed the separation rank R throughout our simulations, to investigate convergence and accuracy of the separated series expansion method. However, in practical applications, the appropriate separation rank should be identified on

fly, i.e., while the simulation is running. To address this question, in the previous section, we propose an adaptive strategy based on the spectrum α = {α1, . . . , αR } of the separated series, that is, increasing the separation rank R if the ratio αR/α1 >θ. The corresponding adaptive algorithm initialized with a separation rank r is denoted as Ar

SSE, and it is studied hereafter with reference to Eq. (28). In Fig. 10 we plot R versus time for different thresholds θ. It is seen that the adaptive algorithm yields a separation rank that increases in time. In particular, the case θ = 10−3 yields R = 10 at t = 3, which results in a slightly larger error than the one obtained for fixed R = 10. In Fig. 11, we compare the accuracy of the A6

SSE method with θ = 5 · 10−4 and the ANOVA method (level 2). Specifically, we study the relative L2 error of the solution to Eq. (28) for different number of random variables, i.e., m = 13, m = 24, and m = 54. We first notice that the error in the A6

SSE method seems to be slightly independent of m. On the other hand, the error of ANOVA method increases with m, although such an error can be improved by increasing the interaction order. However, this would yield an increasing number of collocation points. For example, increasing the interaction order from two to three for m = 54 would increase the number of collocation points from 70498 to 8578270 (see [64]). In Fig. 12, we compare the computational time of the separated series expansion method, with the ANOVA method of level two and sparse grid of level three on the excitation space. The simulations are performed on a single CPU of Intel Xeon E5540 (2.53 GHz) and the results are normalized with respect to the computing time using the tensor product for the case m = 3. It is seen that the separated expansion method costs less than the ANOVA level 2 when m ≥ 24 and R ≤ 8. In the case of equation (27), the separated expansion method is more efficient than ANOVA, as it reaches the same error level with a small separation rank (R < 8).
