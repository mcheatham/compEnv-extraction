31(d,p) level [29â€“31]. It was shown that this level is quite satisfactory for computing ESP and I [2,14]. Molecular geometries were optimized at the same level. All test data were produced by Multiwfn 2.3.2, of which the parallel mode was enabled. All calculations were done with single QuadCore Intel i7
