Analysis of Tandem Mass Spectra. Tandem mass spectra were analyzed using the following protocol. First, a software algorithm called 2to3 12 was used to determine the appropriate charge state (either +2 or +3) of multiply charged peptide mass spectra and delete spectra of poor quality. Each tandem mass spectrum after 2to3 was searched twice against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant protein database (downloaded 04/15/2002 with 907 654 protein sequence entries) using two different versions of SEQUEST. The first search used a previously reported cross
-
correlation scoring algorithm,3 while the second search, used a normalized cross
-
correlation routine (SEQUEST
-
NORM) described below. All searches were parallelized and performed on a Beowulf computer cluster consisting of 34 1.2
-
GHz Athlon CPUs. Tandem mass spectra was searched without considering any enzyme cleavage specificity.
