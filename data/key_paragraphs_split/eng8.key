as well as the upper bounds of both discretization and truncation errors. It seems that our numerical results are highly accurate even in the case of extreme x, e.g. x10 and x−10, and agree with those obtained by Feng and Lin [8] to 12 decimal points. Besides, it takes only 0.05 seconds to generate one numerical result via our method. All the computations in this paper are conducted using MATLAB® 7.1 on a laptop with a 2.67GHz CPU.
