In this section, a number of experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed split Bregman iteration (PSBI) algorithm for the fourth
-
order diffusive model (6), which will be compared with the split Bregman iteration (SBI) for second
-
order diffusive model provided in [17]. All experiments are generated in MATLAB 7.10 environment on a desktop with Windows 7 operating system, 3.00GHz Intel Pentium(R) D CPU, and 1.00GB memory.
