7 language and experiments are made on a Pentium 3.0 GHz Processor with 1.0 GB of memory. In the parameter of PSO [25]: population size is 300. The number of generation is 100. c1 and c2 are set to be 1.8 and 2.0, respectively. And vmax is 5% of the search space. The inertia weight is set to 0.8. The following differential evolution parameters have been used after a number of careful experimentation: The population size is 300, the number of generation is 100, the scale factor F and crossover probability CR is 0.5, and 0.9, respectively. For the five mutation strategies of DE, ‘‘DE/current
